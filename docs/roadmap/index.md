# Roadmap

DeepGroundwater is looking to expand out of Beta development, and into a weekly-updated blog with  articles from both the board members, and scientific community. 

## Features

Below are ideas we are pursuing at DeepGroundwater to make the user, and research sharing, experience better:


- [ ] Zenodo API Tools
- [ ] arXiv API Tools
- [ ] s3 API Tools 
- [ ] Dockerization tutorials for complex apps
- [ ] Data Catalogs for dataset management

If you're interested in tackling these ideas, feel free to open an issue in our GitHub page.
