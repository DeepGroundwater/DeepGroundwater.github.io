# Doing AI Hydrology to assess water resources for AI expansion... to continue doing AI Hydrology

In January (2025), the [Stargate project](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/) was annunced by the president of the United States, which will be a $500 billion investment over the next four years building new AI infrastructure. 

In 1956, we introduced the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act (NIDHA) with an authorization of $25 billion (equivalent to $215 billion in 2024). The typical take on the NIDHA is that it facilitated an economic growth, national security and personal mobility. Another take, however, is that the highways destroyed American cities, segregated economic classes, and created a mobility barrier requiring a personal automobile. There is no doubt, what-so-ever, that the NIDHA changed American life and culture (for better or for worse...). 

Part of the Stargate project is a committment from the federal government to eliminate any barriers to the exampsion of AI Infrastructure. Presumably, this means no need for environmental regulation, nor consideration of the impact to American lives or culture. 

Expanding AI Infrastructure will require increasing H2O uptake, consumptive use, and pollution discharge. Even with environmental regulation in place. The hydrological sciences now are thouroughly imbedded with AI Research. Common "low hanging fruit" papers are simply just slight modification of Deep Learning architectures, to keep up with the latest advancemets from computer science, and adding a line on a standard benchmarking dataset. This is not by accident, but was actually called for, by early adopters of the third book of AI in hydrology (including me).

Note: This blog was written without the use of LLMs. Google was used sparingly.
